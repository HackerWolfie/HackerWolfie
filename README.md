## Hi there! ✨

### 🐾 About Me

Hi there! I'm a Computer Science engineering student with a passion for cybersecurity, hacking, and all things tech.  
Currently building my skills to become an **ethical hacker**, which is my dream 🌟💻 

I’m constantly learning, building, testing and breaking (ethically).  
I love exploring how systems work, how they can be abused, and how to defend them.   
Cybersecurity isn’t just my career goal — it’s something that truly brings me joy.

Welcome to my space — it's still growing, just like me 🚀
